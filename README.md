# Birthday Buddy
🎉 Birthday Buddy

A tiny GitHub-powered birthday tracker that updates itself.

Birthday Buddy is a simple Python project that keeps track of birthdays and automatically updates a log file whenever someone’s birthday is checked or added. It uses GitHub Actions, a scheduled job, and a lightweight log.txt file to show activity over time.

This project is intentionally minimal — it exists to show:

practical use of Python scripting,

working with files & data,

setting up automated workflows,

using GitHub Actions like a pro,

and clean, readable repo structure.
